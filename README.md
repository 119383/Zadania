The follwing repository contains files, used for tasks assigned to me by a company that I will not specify here. The text of the assigned task was the following:

>Please create an automated test using Selenium, which would run a query through Google, searching for phrase "a car". The test is supposed to check and print the answer to following questions.
>How many search results are there?
>Are first 10 results displayed?
>Are there any pictures?

Please note, that it was actually the first time I have ever used Selenium.
